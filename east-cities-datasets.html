		<td>This research was carried out in China between December 2011 and February 2013. Data was collected from 2,700 privately-owned and 148 state-owned firms.

The objective of Enterprise Surveys is to obtain feedback from businesses on the state of the private sector as well as to help in building a panel of enterprise data that will make it possible to track changes in the business environment over time, thus allowing, for example, impact assessments of reforms. Through interviews with firms in the manufacturing and services sectors, the survey assesses the constraints to private sector growth and creates statistically significant business environment indicators that are comparable across countries.

Usually Enterprise Surveys focus only on private companies, but in China, a special sample of fully state-owned establishments was included as this is an important part of the economy. Data on 148 state-owned enterprises is provided separately from the data of 2,700 private sector firms. To maintain comparability of the China Enterprise Surveys to surveys conducted in other countries, only the dataset of privately sector firms should be used.</td>

		<td>The evolution and development of the three-dimensional (3D) architectural landscape is the basis of proper urban planning, eco-environment construction and the improvement of environmental quality. This paper presents the spatiotemporal characteristics of the 3D architectural landscape of the Shinan and Shibei districts in Qingdao, China, based on buildings’ 3D information extracted from Quickbird images from 2003 to 2012, supported by Barista, landscape metrics and GIS. The results demonstrated that: (1) Shinan and Shibei districts expanded vertically and urban land use intensity increased noticeably from year to year. (2) Significant differences in the 3D architectural landscape existed among the western, central and eastern regions, and among the 26 sub-districts over the study period. The differentiation was consistent with the diverse development history, function and planning of the two districts. Finally, we found that population correlates positively with the variation in the 3D architectural landscape. This research provides an important reference for related studies, urban planning and eco-city construction.</td>

The principal investigators based their definition of income on cash payments and on a broad range of additional components: payments in kind valued at market prices, agricultural output produced for self-consumption valued at market prices, the value of ration coupons and other direct subsidies, and the imputed value of housing. Data were collected through a series of questionnaire-based interviews conducted in rural and urban areas in 1988, 1995, 2002, 2007, and 2013. Individual respondents reported on their economic status, employment, level of education, sources of income, household composition, and household expenditures.</td>

		<td>The East Asia Social Survey (EASS) is a biennial social survey project that serves as a cross-national network of four General Social Survey type surveys in East Asia -- the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS), the Japanese General Social Survey (JGSS), the Korean General Social Survey (KGSS), and the Taiwan Social Change Survey (TSCS). Founded in 2003, the EASS involves the coordination of participating institutions, each representing the four East Asian societies, who collectively determine survey module topics and questionnaires. The participating institutions include the National Survey Research Center at Renmin University of China in Beijing, the JGSS Research Center at Osaka University of Commerce in Osaka, the Survey Research Center as Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, and the Institute of Sociology at Academia Sinica in Taipei. Each individual institution incorporates EASS topical modules into the preexisting framework of their respective General Social Survey designs. EASS focuses on questions and issues that are commonly relevant to East Asian societies, with the goal of creating comparative data on diverse aspects of social lives in East Asia. Each year and corresponding survey topical module has a specific focus within the general scope of the EASS; module topics cover family, culture, health, and social capital.</td>

		<td>The AsiaBarometer, 2004 represents a cross-national effort to study the lives of the peoples of East and Southeast Asia on physical, psychological, and sociological dimensions. The project was designed to capture the extent to which respondents experience the affective and cognitive qualities of life, focusing on their assessments of their own lives as well as their relationships to family, neighborhood, workplace, social institutions, political institutions, and the marketplace. Attitudes toward development, democracy, and regionalization were examined, as were the types of goods and services desired and consumer habits. Respondents were queried on their overall personal satisfaction as well as their satisfaction with their friendships, family life, marriage, standard of living, housing, household income, health, education, neighbors, job, leisure time, public safety, the condition of the environment, the social welfare system, and the political system. Data were gathered on the respondents' personal priorities and those they had for their children, as well as their level of trust in others, their inclination to help others, and what characteristics and affiliations they used to identify themselves. Respondents were asked to rate the efficacy of their national governments in handling the economy, political corruption, human rights, unemployment, crime, public services, immigration, ethnic conflict, religious conflict, and environmental problems. Additional questions asked whether government officials were responsive to problems of the general population, what type of political systems respondents favored, and the extent to which the national government, the local government, the army, the legal system, the police, the national legislative branch (e.g., Parliament, Congress), the public education system, large domestic companies, multinational companies, trade/labor unions, the media, and other nongovernmental organizations (e.g., environmental, social advocacy groups, and nonprofit organizations) could be trusted to operate in the best interests of society. Participants were asked which macro-socioeconomic issues they were most concerned with and what matters they believed the government should spend more or less on. Respondents were polled on their level of personal involvement in political, governmental, and community affairs, the inclusiveness of the government, and their perspectives on the importance of political and electoral participation. Additional questions addressed respondent exposure to and opinions of foreign companies, peoples, governments, and cultures. Market analysis inquiries included what products respondents owned, planned to own in the near future, or desired to own, as well as what consumer services they had used or would like to use. Respondents were asked about their modes of transportation, their current types of residence, whether or not they planned to own their own residences, and the availability of public utilities. Respondents were surveyed on what foreign and domestic companies they were familiar with and which forms of media they used to obtain consumer and political information. Background information includes age, sex, occupation, employment status, household income, family structure, number of people in household, number of children, education, marital status, English proficiency, religious affiliation, and religious participation.</td>

		<td>The Correlates of War (COW) project was founded in 1963 by J. David Singer, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. The original and continuing goal of the project has been the systematic accumulation of scientific knowledge about war. Key principles of the project include a commitment to standard scientific principles of replication, data reliability, documentation, review, and the transparency of data collection procedures.

The COW project seeks to facilitate the collection, dissemination, and use of accurate and reliable quantitative data in international relations (IR). It also seeks to expand available data for IR research through 1) a number of ongoing internal projects and 2) encouraging scholars within the COW community to engage in guided research through the Data Set Hosting Program.

The COW project has moved to institutionalize the loosely structured organization of the original project based at the University of Michigan, while also maintaining the involvement of many collaborators at widely dispersed locations.

To simultaneously maintain a large number of cross-national and cross-time datasets, the COW project has implemented a distributed system of dataset hosting based on the notion of "coordinated decentralization". The goal is for each major dataset to be adopted by a "home" institution and a "host" individual who will agree to maintain a dataset and its related documentation for a period of time, following guidelines designed to ensure continued consistency with COW standards.

The project was transferred from the University of Michigan to The Pennsylvania State University in March 2001. The governance structures of the project include a director, associated director, and advisory board.</td>

For this survey, respondents were asked to examine topics such as the attractiveness of different national cultures and values, the effectiveness of nations as regional leaders and problem-solvers, the affinity of nations as trade partners, levels of human capital, attractiveness of educational institutions, and the emergence of regional identities. Participants also gave their opinions about the growing economic and political integration in East Asia and the impact this has on underlying regional tensions, including how likely there would be a military conflict in East Asia in the next ten years. Similarly, respondents answered queries regarding the economic, military, and political influence of China, Japan, and the United States in Southeast Asia, China and the United States as military threats to each other, China's rise as a leader in Asia, and the military presence of the United States in Asia. Further questions asked about the creation of a free trade area in China, Japan and South Korea, trade and investment among these nations, preferred economic systems, countries' willingness to promote democracy and human rights internationally, the use of diplomacy, and the respect for rule of law and sovereignty of other nations. Finally, participants gave their views on the leadership of international organizations, and the influence of one country's popular culture on another.</td>
