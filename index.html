		<td>This research was carried out in China between December 2011 and February 2013. Data was collected from 2,700 privately-owned and 148 state-owned firms.

The objective of Enterprise Surveys is to obtain feedback from businesses on the state of the private sector as well as to help in building a panel of enterprise data that will make it possible to track changes in the business environment over time, thus allowing, for example, impact assessments of reforms. Through interviews with firms in the manufacturing and services sectors, the survey assesses the constraints to private sector growth and creates statistically significant business environment indicators that are comparable across countries.

Usually Enterprise Surveys focus only on private companies, but in China, a special sample of fully state-owned establishments was included as this is an important part of the economy. Data on 148 state-owned enterprises is provided separately from the data of 2,700 private sector firms. To maintain comparability of the China Enterprise Surveys to surveys conducted in other countries, only the dataset of privately sector firms should be used.</td>

		<td>The evolution and development of the three-dimensional (3D) architectural landscape is the basis of proper urban planning, eco-environment construction and the improvement of environmental quality. This paper presents the spatiotemporal characteristics of the 3D architectural landscape of the Shinan and Shibei districts in Qingdao, China, based on buildings’ 3D information extracted from Quickbird images from 2003 to 2012, supported by Barista, landscape metrics and GIS. The results demonstrated that: (1) Shinan and Shibei districts expanded vertically and urban land use intensity increased noticeably from year to year. (2) Significant differences in the 3D architectural landscape existed among the western, central and eastern regions, and among the 26 sub-districts over the study period. The differentiation was consistent with the diverse development history, function and planning of the two districts. Finally, we found that population correlates positively with the variation in the 3D architectural landscape. This research provides an important reference for related studies, urban planning and eco-city construction.</td>

The principal investigators based their definition of income on cash payments and on a broad range of additional components: payments in kind valued at market prices, agricultural output produced for self-consumption valued at market prices, the value of ration coupons and other direct subsidies, and the imputed value of housing. Data were collected through a series of questionnaire-based interviews conducted in rural and urban areas in 1988, 1995, 2002, 2007, and 2013. Individual respondents reported on their economic status, employment, level of education, sources of income, household composition, and household expenditures.</td>

Founded in 2003, the EASS involves the coordination of participating institutions, each representing the four East Asian societies, who collectively determine survey module topics and questionnaires. The participating institutions include the National Survey Research Center at Renmin University of China in Beijing, the JGSS Research Center at Osaka University of Commerce in Osaka, the Survey Research Center as Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, and the Institute of Sociology at Academia Sinica in Taipei. Each individual institution incorporates EASS topical modules into the preexisting framework of their respective General Social Survey designs. EASS focuses on questions and issues that are commonly relevant to East Asian societies, with the goal of creating comparative data on diverse aspects of social lives in East Asia. Each year and corresponding survey topical module has a specific focus within the general scope of the EASS; module topics cover family, culture, health, and social capital.</td>

The project was designed to capture the extent to which respondents experience the affective and cognitive qualities of life, focusing on their assessments of their own lives as well as their relationships to family, neighborhood, workplace, social institutions, political institutions, and the marketplace. Attitudes toward development, democracy, and regionalization were examined, as were the types of goods and services desired and consumer habits. Respondents were queried on their overall personal satisfaction as well as their satisfaction with their friendships, family life, marriage, standard of living, housing, household income, health, education, neighbors, job, leisure time, public safety, the condition of the environment, the social welfare system, and the political system. Data were gathered on the respondents' personal priorities and those they had for their children, as well as their level of trust in others, their inclination to help others, and what characteristics and affiliations they used to identify themselves. Respondents were asked to rate the efficacy of their national governments in handling the economy, political corruption, human rights, unemployment, crime, public services, immigration, ethnic conflict, religious conflict, and environmental problems. Additional questions asked whether government officials were responsive to problems of the general population, what type of political systems respondents favored, and the extent to which the national government, the local government, the army, the legal system, the police, the national legislative branch (e.g., Parliament, Congress), the public education system, large domestic companies, multinational companies, trade/labor unions, the media, and other nongovernmental organizations (e.g., environmental, social advocacy groups, and nonprofit organizations) could be trusted to operate in the best interests of society. Participants were asked which macro-socioeconomic issues they were most concerned with and what matters they believed the government should spend more or less on. Respondents were polled on their level of personal involvement in political, governmental, and community affairs, the inclusiveness of the government, and their perspectives on the importance of political and electoral participation. Additional questions addressed respondent exposure to and opinions of foreign companies, peoples, governments, and cultures. Market analysis inquiries included what products respondents owned, planned to own in the near future, or desired to own, as well as what consumer services they had used or would like to use. Respondents were asked about their modes of transportation, their current types of residence, whether or not they planned to own their own residences, and the availability of public utilities. Respondents were surveyed on what foreign and domestic companies they were familiar with and which forms of media they used to obtain consumer and political information. Background information includes age, sex, occupation, employment status, household income, family structure, number of people in household, number of children, education, marital status, English proficiency, religious affiliation, and religious participation.</td>

		<td>The Correlates of War (COW) project was founded in 1963 by J. David Singer, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. The original and continuing goal of the project has been the systematic accumulation of scientific knowledge about war. Key principles of the project include a commitment to standard scientific principles of replication, data reliability, documentation, review, and the transparency of data collection procedures.

The COW project seeks to facilitate the collection, dissemination, and use of accurate and reliable quantitative data in international relations (IR). It also seeks to expand available data for IR research through 1) a number of ongoing internal projects and 2) encouraging scholars within the COW community to engage in guided research through the Data Set Hosting Program.

The COW project has moved to institutionalize the loosely structured organization of the original project based at the University of Michigan, while also maintaining the involvement of many collaborators at widely dispersed locations.

To simultaneously maintain a large number of cross-national and cross-time datasets, the COW project has implemented a distributed system of dataset hosting based on the notion of "coordinated decentralization". The goal is for each major dataset to be adopted by a "home" institution and a "host" individual who will agree to maintain a dataset and its related documentation for a period of time, following guidelines designed to ensure continued consistency with COW standards.

The project was transferred from the University of Michigan to The Pennsylvania State University in March 2001. The governance structures of the project include a director, associated director, and advisory board.</td>

For this survey, respondents were asked to examine topics such as the attractiveness of different national cultures and values, the effectiveness of nations as regional leaders and problem-solvers, the affinity of nations as trade partners, levels of human capital, attractiveness of educational institutions, and the emergence of regional identities. Participants also gave their opinions about the growing economic and political integration in East Asia and the impact this has on underlying regional tensions, including how likely there would be a military conflict in East Asia in the next ten years. Similarly, respondents answered queries regarding the economic, military, and political influence of China, Japan, and the United States in Southeast Asia, China and the United States as military threats to each other, China's rise as a leader in Asia, and the military presence of the United States in Asia. Further questions asked about the creation of a free trade area in China, Japan and South Korea, trade and investment among these nations, preferred economic systems, countries' willingness to promote democracy and human rights internationally, the use of diplomacy, and the respect for rule of law and sovereignty of other nations. Finally, participants gave their views on the leadership of international organizations, and the influence of one country's popular culture on another.</td>

Moreover, this study sought to assess American public opinion (Part 1, Public Opinion Survey, United States) on a variety of challenges facing the United States today including international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, conflict in the Middle East, the rising economic and political power of Asia, economic competition from abroad, and threats to energy supplies and the environment. This data collection also provides an understanding of how the Chinese (Part 2, Public Opinion Survey, China) and Indian (Part 3, Public Opinion Survey, India) publics view their nations' international challenges and opportunities and their respective roles as emerging great powers.

We tested 1,162 Han Chinese participants in six sites and found that rice-growing southern China is more interdependent and holistic-thinking than the wheat-growing north. To control for confounds like climate, we tested people from neighboring counties along the rice-wheat border and found differences that were just as large.

		<td>When members of one ethnic group feel threatened by population trends favoring ethnic "others," would perceived economic gains associated with such population change (as in many cases of migration) reduce perceived threats to security and interethnic hostility? An ideal quasi-experimental setting for addressing this question is Chinese cross-border migration into the Russian Far East, for which the author designed and directed an opinion survey in September 2000 with 1,010 respondents selected through stratified random sampling. Findings based on multiple regression analysis suggest that individuals who perceive interactions with members of a culturally distant ethnic group as economically beneficial feel less threatened and favor less hostile responses toward ethnic "others" -- even if these individuals adhere to negative stereotypes against the latter. Strong effects of perceived economic gains (or losses) with respect to the local economy endure when controlled for party identification, perceptions of relative deprivation, perceptions of the neighboring state's intent to undertake aggressive actions, and perceptions of military balance, as well as for local economic and demographic trends. For both threat and hostility, perceptions of total economic effects attributed to ethnic "others" -- but not perceptions of relative gains among groups -- are found to be a significant predictor.</td>

		<td>The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is composed of terrorist events recorded for the entire world from 1970 through 1997. The data were originally collected by the Pinkerton Global Intelligence Service (PGIS). Throughout the data collection period PGIS employed a broad definition of terrorism: the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. The data include "terrorist groups" identified as specific named groups as well as generic groupings like "rebels" or "student protesters." The researchers arranged with PGIS to move 58 boxes of original hard copies of the PGIS terrorism database to a secure location at the University of Maryland. A Web-based data entry system was developed to match the design of the generic incident card used by PGIS in their coding. In addition, automatic entry fields were created in the Web-based interface to be automatically applied under specific circumstances. Once data entry began, the researchers initiated the ongoing process of data verification. In order to develop the Global Terrorism Database 1.1 (GTD1.1), the research team supplemented the original PGIS data by incorporating incidents found in other data sources that were overlooked by PGIS. For several countries in the data, cases have been added, deleted, or corrected compared to the first release of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD1) [GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE, 1970-1997, (ICPSR 4586)] based on additional coding and investigation. Data in the GTD1.1 contain 61,637 events. Variables provide group name, type of terrorist incident, incident date, region, country, state in the United States, city, whether the incident was just outside of the city, the type of target, the identity and nationality of the target, type of weapons used, whether the incident was considered a success, and whether there was some damage. Further variables classify the total number killed and total number wounded. Further variables provide information about kidnappings and hostages, total number of days and hours held, and amount of ransom demanded and amount paid. Variables also record information about hijackings. Another variable also provides the number of incidents that the case represents.</td>

Researchers were interested in the number and types of software applications that were used by digital activists. Specifically, information was collected on whether software applications were used to circumvent censorship or evade government surveillance, to transfer money or resources, to aid in co-creation by a collaborative group, or for purposes of networking, mobilization, information sharing, or technical violence (destructive/disruptive hacking). The collection illustrates the overall focus of each case of digital activism by defining the cause advanced or defended by the action, the initiator's diagnosis of the problem and its perceived origin, the identification of the targeted audience that the campaign sought to mobilize, as well as the target whose actions the initiators aimed to influence. Finally, each case of digital activism was evaluated in terms of its success or failure in achieving the initiator's objectives, and whether any other positive outcomes were apparent.</td>

These survey responses have now been integrated into one dataset, to facilitate time series analysis.

The surveys provide data from representative national samples of the publics of approximately 81 societies (covering 60 countries) that contain 85 percent of the world's population and cover a full range of variation, from societies with per capita incomes below 300 dollars per year, to societies with per capita incomes of more than 35,000 dollars per year, from long-established democracies to authoritarian states, and from societies with market economies to societies that are in the process of emerging from state-run economies. The surveys cover societies that were historically shaped by a wide variety of religious and cultural traditions, from Christian to Islamic to Confucian to Hindu. The societies covered range from those whose culture emphasizes social conformity and group obligations to societies in which the main emphasis is on human emancipation and self-expression.

Broad topics covered in the integrated file include perception of life, family, work, traditional values, personal finances, religion and morale, the economy, politics and society, the environment, allocation of resources, contemporary social issues, national identity, and technology and its impact on society.

Specifically, respondents were asked whether the following acts were ever justifiable: suicide, cheating on taxes, lying, euthanasia, divorce, and abortion. Respondents were also asked about the groups and associations they belonged to, which ones they worked for voluntarily, the ethnic group(s) they would not want as neighbors, their general state of health, and whether they felt they had free choice and control over their lives. A wide range of items was included on the meaning and purpose of life, such as respondents' views on the value of scientific advances, the demarcation of good and evil, and religious behavior and beliefs. Respondents were also queried about their attitudes toward morality, politics, sexual freedom, marriage, single parenting, child-rearing, and the importance of work, family, politics, and religion in their lives. Questions relating to work included what financial and social benefits were most important to them in a job, how much pride they took in their work, if they were happy with their current position, and their views on owner/state/employee management of business. Questions pertaining to the stability of the world economy and whether respondents were happy with their financial situation were also asked. Respondents' opinions on various forms of political action, the most important aims for their countries, confidence in various civil and governmental institutions, and whether they would fight in a war for their country were also elicited.

Demographic information includes family income, number of people residing in the home, size of locality, region of residence, occupation of the head of household, and the respondent's age, sex, occupation, education, religion, religiosity, political party and union membership, and left-right political self-placement.</td>

Data are recorded for each dyad for each year between 1948-1973. Part 2 contains domestic event summaries for the same 31 political entities. The variables measure frequency, intensity, and dimension of interaction (frequency and intensity) for both conflictive and cooperative domestic events. Data are recorded by year for each entity. In Part 3, a variable records the total number of international events initiated by each actor in each year, while a second variable calculates this yearly total as a percentage of all events initiated by the same actor during the 26-year period. Part 4 provides similar information, but with the dyad actor-target as a unit of analysis. One variable records the total number of events initiated by the actor toward the target over the whole time period, while a second variable calculates the number of events directed at one target as a percentage of the events directed at all targets.</td>

The data include assessments of the political and civil rights of the general population (using a seven-point scale, i.e., 1, most freedom, to 7, least freedom), an overall freedom rating for the country (using a three-point scale, i.e, free, partly free, and not free), and the direction in which this rating appeared to be moving. Surveys after 1972 have added variables that indicate whether a change in the evaluation since the previous survey was due to internal events in the country or to new information about existing conditions. Before 1973, only the presence or absence of change is noted. Thereafter, an increase in the number of coding categories enables the direction of the change to be recorded. The 1976 data include four additional variables applicable to 142 cases and provide information about the system of government and the economy of most of the nations studied. The rationale used in assigning the seven categories on the continuum of most to least freedom can be found in Appendix III of the codebook, including which civil and political rights were considered critical in order for a nation to garner each rating.</td>

		</td>
		<td>The World Health Organization (WHO)'s Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) is a longitudinal follow-up of a cohort of ageing and older adults. SAGE has been built on the experience and standardized instruments of WHO's 2000/2001 Multi-country Survey Study (MCSS) and the 2002/2004 World Health Surveys (WHS).

These surveys focused on health and health-related outcomes and their determinants and impacts in nationally representative samples. These data will address data gaps on ageing, adult health and well-being in lower and middle income countries, whilst being comparable to surveys conducted in higher income countries (such as the United States' Health and Retirement Study (HRS), English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE)). One of the major drivers of this effort has been the lack of comparability of self-reported health status in international health surveys due to systematic biases in reporting, despite using similar instruments and attempts at making questions conceptually equivalent in translation. SAGE uses standard instruments developed over the last decade, a common design and training approach with explicit strategies for making data comparable to cover a wide range of issues that directly and indirectly impact health and well-being.

The survey methodology and research design has included a number of methods to address methods for detecting and correcting for systematic reporting biases in health interview surveys, including vignette methodologies, objective performance tests and biomarkers. A number of techniques have also been employed to improve data comparability, including using common definitions of concepts, common methods of data collection and translations, rigorous sample design and post hoc harmonization. The 2007-2010 SAGE Wave 1 data from six countries (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa) is the follow-up survey project to the 2002-2004 WHO data, which constitutes Wave 0 of WHO's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE). A sample of these respondents from SAGE Wave 0 are included in this follow-up 2007-2010 SAGE Wave 1 in the six countries, with new respondents added to ensure a nationally representative sample.</td>

		<td>The goal of the ICSOPRU project was to improve the management of research teams and institutions and increase awareness of their responsibility concerning proper application of research results. Concrete objectives were twofold: (1) on the international level, to make widely available comparable facts and experiences concerning the management of research teams and to promote multilateral as well as bilateral cooperation in this field, and (2) on the national level to provide all those concerned (science policy-makers, research managers, scientists, engineers) with substantive information on the state of their national research potential and to encourage them, on the basis of this information compared eventually with similar information from other countries, to take self-corrective actions as needed to improve the level of effectiveness and productivity of the research teams and institutions. Seventeen countries from Africa, the Arab States, Asia, Europe and Latin America took part in ICSOPRU. There were four stages or rounds of data collection: six countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, Hungary, Poland, Sweden) in Round 1 (between February and September 1974), six countries (Argentina, Egypt, India, Republic of Korea [South], Poland, Ukrainian S.S.R.) in Round 2 (between June 1978 and September 1981), five countries (Brazil, India, Nigeria, Spain, Ukrainian S.S.R.) in Round 3 (between October 1981 and November 1985), and four countries (China, Ghana, Hungary, Mexico) in Round 4 (between May 1985 and June 1987). Each round of questionnaires had different items (except for Rounds 2 and 3 which were the same). Round 1 items included general administrative information relevant to the research units answered by the administrator of the unit, scientific information on the research unit and information relevant to the unit's head answered by the head of the unit, individual information answered by scientists and engineers of the unit, individual information answered by technicians of the unit, and external evaluation of the research units from various scientific and administrative perspectives answered by external evaluators. Rounds 2 and 3 included general information about the research unit answered by the head of the unit, information on the respondent and his or her evaluation of the research unit's management, items on productivity and effectiveness answered by head of the unit along with scientists, engineers, and technicians of the unit, EV-rating of the research unit's effectiveness on a series of dimensions dealing with scientific or social criteria and administrative criteria answered by external evaluators. The fourth round of questionnaires included information on the institutional environment of the research unit answered by the head of the institution, general information on the research unit answered by the head of the unit, information on the respondent and his or her evaluation of the research unit's management, items on productivity and effectiveness answered by the head of the unit, scientists, engineers, and technicians.</td>

		</td>
		<td>The purpose of the survey was to study, in 18 countries of Asia and Europe, how democracy (or quasi-democracy) functions in response to various domestic and international stimuli, with a focus on the rise of civil society and the deepening of globalization. The 18 countries surveyed include from East and Southeast Asia: Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines, and from Western Europe: the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Sweden, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece. The questionnaire covers generally five topics: (1) identity, (2) trust, (3) satisfaction, (4) beliefs and actions, and (5) socio-economic attributes. For the first topic, the survey asked respondents for their nationality and its importance to them, whether it was respected by others and given fair treatment in international economic and political affairs, and how proud of it they were. Respondents were also asked how important it was for them to have citizenship, fluency in their country's dominant language, and to practice their nationality's dominant religion. Respondents were asked if they identified with a community or a group rather than a nationality (i.e. neighborhoods, ethnic group, and religion), if they belonged to larger groups in which people from other countries were included (i.e. European, Asian, and Islamic), and how proud they were of their country's achievements or politics. The next topic asked respondents to assess their level of confidence in their country's government and endeavors (i.e. political parties, law and courts, and mass media) and in international organizations (i.e. World Bank and NATO), to name their country's foreign ministers, and if they could name the five countries with permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. For the third topic, respondents were asked how well their countries handled issues of politics and citizens, about their personal life situation, their country's development, and the international situation. Regarding beliefs and actions, respondents were asked to comment on the effects of development around the world (i.e., products, money, people, and information being able to move globally), the importance of social issues (i.e., human rights and unemployment), and whether such issues should be dealt with by the country alone or by all countries working together, and if they agreed with specific statements others have made about the government, economy, and politics. They were questioned about their interest in politics, their left-to-right stance in politics, what political activities they had participated in, whether they had voted in the presidential and/or local elections, which political party they felt closest to, and their level of satisfaction with politics in their society. The final topic included questions on the respondent's awareness of political or governmental affairs through different types of media (i.e., newspaper, radio, and television), life satisfaction, fluency in English, frequency with which they attended religious services, religious domination, sex, age, living situation, highest completed level of education, employment, household's living standards, income, and ethnic group.</td>

The module was developed to explicate a number of propositions about war and peace between nations and to combine these propositions into an operating model of an international relations system. It is intended to serve as a technical companion to and provide supplementary flow charts and program listings for the War-Peace module developed in Jeffrey A. Krend's "War and Peace in the International System: Deriving an All-Computer Heuristic." Actors were assessed for their response to perceived threats in either a cooperative or hostile manner relative to each issue in seven key issue areas: German reunification, Israeli survival, Soviet leadership in the communist world, military support for Egypt, national survival and development, international cooperation, and big power hegemony. In addition, the technical aspects of the model were generalized into design criteria for simulations of large-scale social systems in general.</td>
